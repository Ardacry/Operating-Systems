The folder contains two files with .c postfixes
called diskschedule.c and resultCalculator.c

It additionally contains a MakeFile to create executables
for each source code files. The user can type "make" from
the terminal while in the folder and obtain executables.
Furthermore, "rm clean" will clean all existing executables.

diskschedule.c :

diskschedule.c contains the C source code of a program
that simulates the disk scheduling algorithms FCFS, SSTF,
SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK. It takes headposition of the
moving arm as an input argument. Additionally, it takes a file
input but if no supplied, it generates 1000 requests randomly.

The program can be called from terminal as :

./diskschedule <headposition> <inputfile>

The program creates an output file and writes the results in it.

resultCalculator.c :

resultCalculator.c contains the C source code of a program
that calculates the mean and standard deviation of the each programs
total head movement. It uses the "Results" file to calculate. The 
"Results" file contains each 100 iteration of algorithms total
head movement written line by line.

The program can be called from terminal as :

./resultCalculator

Program writes the results on to the screen.

Additionally the folder contains a report with .pdf format that
has a table of average and standard deviation values of each algorithms
with 100 random iterations. Also folder has a "TestResults" text file
that contains the outcome of every 100 iterations with each algorithms.
